# Alexa-Discord-REST

#Indtroduction
Alexa-to-Discord is a work in progress Alexa skill which allows users to interect with their discord guild(s) using an Alexa enabled device.

#Getting Started

Firstly you are going to want to make sure you have a [Discord account](https://discordapp.com/) and a [Amazon Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/), although not neccasary I highly suggest getting a [Heroku account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) as this will allow you to host your code for free without having to mess around with SSL certificated or HTTPS.
 
###Creating a discord application.
1. Go to the [discord developers portal](https://discordapp.com/developers) and log in with your discord account.
2. Click on the "My Apps" link in the menu on the left.
3. Click on "New App".
4. Give it a name and optionally description and icon. Once you are done, press the "Create App" button.
5. After that you are going to want to click the "Create a bot user" button.
6. Reveal the bot token and store this somewhere for use later on.
